## 2. Attack Timeline

1. **Initial Contact**: Victim receives a phone call from "Coinbase Security", told of a breach involving leaked wallet info.
2. **Emotional Pressure**: Victim advised there's a "6-hour delay pull" to stop the breach — but only temporarily.
3. **Spoofed Email**: Fake Coinbase email with logos and layout reinforces urgency.
4. **Fake Treasury Wallet**: Victim asked to transfer crypto to a new wallet “for safekeeping”, offered a 2% bonus incentive.
5. **Social Engineering for Access**: Fraudsters extract 2FA codes and gain control of Coinbase account.
6. **Asset Movement**: Crypto drained and moved through ETH → BTC → Monero → cold wallets.
7. **Obfuscation**: Funds left untouched or laundered through high-value asset purchases(e.g., jewellrey) or 'crypto for cash' transactions.

## 3. Platform Vulnerabilities Exploited

| Weakness | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ✅ No IP Geo-Protection | Fraudsters logged in from suspicious IPs undetected |
| ✅ Lack of Behavior Anomaly Detection | Sudden full-balance transfers triggered no alerts |
| ✅ Inadequate Email Domain Education | Victim believed `coinbase.security@gmail.com` was official |
| ✅ No Transaction Holds | Crypto moved instantly without transactional friction |

---

## 4. Defensive Recommendations

### 💻 For Platforms:
- Enforce IP geo-sensitive login restrictions
- Display domain warning banners (e.g., "We never email you from @gmail.com")
- Integrate behavioral red flags (e.g., multiple wallet creation → large outbound tx)
- Introduce real-time freeze feature if account compromise suspected

### 🧠 For Users:
- Never share 2FA codes — *no platform will ever request them*
- Bookmark official URLs and avoid clicking inbound links
- If you're being rushed, it's likely a scam
- Use a hardware wallet with manual confirmation for large amounts
